## Run this coomand on the root folder:

npm i

## To execute the test:

npx browserstack-node-sdk playwright test --config=playwright.bs.config.js

Note:
I shared a link to th browserstack reports since the account used do not have share public permission.
You need a .env file that has the secrets

## Images of the runs
